Python Packaging User Guide
===========================

The "Python Packaging User Guide" (PyPUG) aims to be the authoritative resource on
how to package and install distributions in Python using current tools.

The guide is currently maintained by the "Python Packaging Authority" (PyPA).
It was forked from the “Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging” in March 2013, which was
maintained by Tarek Ziadé.  Thank you Tarek for all your efforts in Python
packaging.

To follow the development of Python packaging, see the `Python
Packaging Authority <https://www.pypa.io>`_.

The html version of the Guide is currently available online at
http://packaging.python.org.
